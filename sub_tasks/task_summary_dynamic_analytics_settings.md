# dynamic_analytics_settings

Successfully implemented dynamic data functionality for the analytics and settings pages, replacing the static mock data with real database data. 

1. Created two new React hooks:
   - `useAnalytics.ts`: Fetches analytics data from Supabase and processes it for the UI
   - `useBusinessSettings.ts`: Fetches and updates business settings with proper error handling

2. Updated the analytics page to:
   - Use the new useAnalytics hook to fetch real data
   - Respect the selected time range (7d, 30d, 90d)
   - Display appropriate loading and error states

3. Updated the settings page to:
   - Use the new useBusinessSettings hook to fetch data
   - Save changes to both business info and settings tables
   - Display loading indicators and handle errors

All changes have been committed and pushed to the feature/dynamic-analytics-settings branch. The implementation follows the project's existing patterns for React Query and data fetching.
